C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s as an extension of the C language. It incorporates both procedural and object-oriented programming features, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of software development tasks. C++ enables developers to write code that is efficient and close to the hardware level, which is why it is widely used in systems programming, game development, real-time simulations, and performance-critical applications. It supports key concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, allowing for modular, reusable, and organized code structures.

One of the standout features of C++ is its ability to blend low-level memory manipulation with high-level abstractions. This dual capability makes it ideal for both learning fundamental programming concepts and building complex software systems. The language also supports generic programming through templates, exception handling for robust error management, and the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides ready-to-use data structures and algorithms. C++ continues to evolve with modern features such as lambda expressions, smart pointers, and multithreading support, making it relevant in today's fast-paced software development environment.

**Anatomy Of Hello World Program**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program always start with the main method

->#include <iostream> --> is a preprocessor directive used to include the contents of a file, typically a header file, into  program.
->using namespace std; --> creating a differnt region  or space to run the program efficinetly.
can also create userdefined namespaces. 
2 ways to use like std::cin or using std::cout.

->int main (){ return 0;} --> the method type here is int means it has to return 0 at the end of the program.

**Variables and Constants**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables are the named unit of data that is assigned a value.
const means constants values that cannot be changed one initialized 
-> // --> for single line comments.
-> /**/ -->for Multi line comments.

**Data Types **
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primitive Data types
int     range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
float   range from 1.2E-38 to 3.4e+38.
double  range from 1.7e-308 to 1.7e+308.
char    can generally store upto 256 characters.
boolean true or false.
void    empty null nothing.

Functions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Functions syntax
 
 returnType functionName(parameters){
        //fucntion body
 }
 //void type is also available that doesnot return anything  and parameters are alos not compulsory
 
pass by value ad pass by reference explained
>pass by value-> A copy of the variable is sent to the function, so the original value doesnâ€™t change.
>pass by reference->The actual variable is sent to the function, so changes affect the original value.


 Global variable 
Global Variable: A variable declared outside all functions and accessible from anywhere in the program.

Scope: The part of the program where a variable can be used.

Function Overloading
Function Overloading is when multiple functions have the same name but different parameters (number or type).
It helps to perform similar operations in different ways using one function name.


Object Oriented Programming

->Everything is an object.
->main() fn can exist without any class
 for reference :- https://www.stroustrup.com/oopsla.pdf

Vector class in cpp
->Vectors in C++ are part of the Standard Template Library (STL).
  They are dynamic arrays that can resize themselves automatically when an element is inserted or deleted.

Why use Vectors over Arrays?
->Arrays have fixed size, vectors can grow or shrink.
->Vectors provide built-in functions for easy element management.
->Memory management is automatic in vectors.


Access Modifiers in classes
 Private:Members declared as private are accessible only within the same class.
 Public:Members declared as public are accessible from outside the class.
 Protected:Members declared as protected are accessible within the class and its derived classes.
